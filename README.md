# Human-Activity-Recognition-with-Machine-Learning

Human activity recognition involves classifying sequences of data gathered from specialized harnesses or smartphones into distinct human activities. This task is complex due to the sheer volume of data produced every second, the temporal characteristics of the observations, and the difficulty in correlating the data with specific movements. In this machine learning project, the goal is to develop a model that can accurately recognize human activities using data collected from smartphones.
